          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Cross-Promotion?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Cross-promotion is a marketing strategy where two or more businesses promote each other's products or services to their respective audiences. For indie makers, this approach is particularly powerful because it allows you to tap into established communities without the massive budgets required for traditional advertising.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The beauty of cross-promotion lies in its mutual benefit structure. Instead of competing for attention, you're collaborating to create value for both audiences while expanding your reach organically.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Cross-Promotion Works for Indies</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Minimal financial investment compared to paid advertising</li>
            <li><strong>Trust-based:</strong> Recommendations come from trusted sources, increasing conversion rates</li>
            <li><strong>Community building:</strong> Helps establish relationships within the indie maker ecosystem</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted reach:</strong> Access to highly relevant audiences who are already interested in similar products</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Types of Cross-Promotion</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Product Bundling</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Partner with complementary products to create value-packed bundles. For example, a productivity app could partner with a note-taking tool to offer a "Complete Productivity Suite."
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Content Collaboration</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Create joint content like blog posts, podcasts, or video series. This approach allows you to share expertise while introducing your audience to your partner's knowledge and products.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Newsletter Swaps</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Exchange mentions or dedicated sections in each other's newsletters. This is particularly effective when your audiences have similar interests but don't completely overlap.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Social Media Cross-Promotion</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Share each other's content, participate in Twitter chats together, or create joint social media campaigns that highlight both products.
          </p>
